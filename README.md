# High-Speed Internet Access in the USA 

This repo contains a small proof-of-concept project that uses data from the Federal Communication Commission (https://www.fcc.gov/general/form-477-county-data-internet-access-services) to build a simple R Shiny dashboard. 

The dashboard contains a few interactive maps and plots. It is meant to be informational and at a very high-level. You can find the dashboard here: https://alisto.shinyapps.io/tech_access_app/

An R Markdown Document (RMD) with a short exploration of the data that prepares it for the dashboard is in the source_data folder, along with the original data in the raw_data subfolder. 

The tech_access_app folder contains the app itself, as well as the data stored in an R Data object (which was produced by the RMD).
